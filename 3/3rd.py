# Given an array and a range a, b. The task is to partition the array around the range
# such that the array is divided into three parts.
# 1) All elements smaller than a come first.
# 2) All elements in range a to b come next.
# 3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
# The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to
# return the modified array.
# Note: The generated output is true if you modify the given array successfully.
# Otherwise false.
# Geeky Challenge: Solve this problem in O(n) time complexity.
