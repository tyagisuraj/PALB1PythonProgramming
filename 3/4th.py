# Given an array arr and a number k. One can apply a swap operation on the array any
# number of times, i.e choose any two index i and j (i < j) and swap arr[i] , arr[j] . Find
# the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal
# to k together, i.e. make them a contiguous subarray.
# Examples :
# Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 6, 3], k = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation: To bring elements 2, 1, 3 together, swap index 2 with 4 (0-based
# indexing), i.e. element arr[2] = 5 with arr[4] = 3 such that final array will be- arr[] = [2,
# 1, 3, 6, 5]
# Input: arr[] = [2, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 4], k = 6
# Output: 2
# Explanation: To bring elements 2, 5, 4 together, swap index 0 with 2 (0-based
# indexing) and index 4 with 6 (0-based indexing) such that final array will be- arr[] =
# [9, 7, 2, 5, 4, 7, 8]
# Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 1, 8], k = 6
# Output: 0

    def minSwap(self, arr, k):
        n = len(arr)
        
        # Step 1: Count elements <= k
        good = 0
        for num in arr:
            if num <= k:
                good += 1
        
        # Step 2: Count bad elements in first window
        bad = 0
        for i in range(good):
            if arr[i] > k:
                bad += 1
        
        min_swaps = bad
        
        # Step 3: Slide window
        for i in range(good, n):
            
            # Remove outgoing element
            if arr[i - good] > k:
                bad -= 1
            
            # Add incoming element
            if arr[i] > k:
                bad += 1
            
            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, bad)
        
        return min_swaps
