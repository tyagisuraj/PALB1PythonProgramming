# Given two arrays a[] and b[], your task is to determine whether b[] is a subset
# of a[].
# Examples:
# Input: a[] = [11, 7, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7, 3], b[] = [11, 3, 7, 1, 7]
# Output: true
# Explanation: b[] is a subset of a[]
# Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6], b[] = [1, 2, 4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: b[] is a subset of a[]
# Input: a[] = [10, 5, 2, 23, 19], b[] = [19, 5, 3]
# Output: false
# Explanation: b[] is not a subset of a[]
class Solution:
    def isSubset(self, a, b):
        
        freq = {}
        
        # Count frequency of elements in a
        for num in a:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        # Check elements of b
        for num in b:
            if num not in freq or freq[num] == 0:
                return False
            freq[num] -= 1
        
        return True
