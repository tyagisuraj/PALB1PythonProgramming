# You are given two arrays a[] and b[], return the Union of both the arrays in any
# order.
# The Union of two arrays is a collection of all distinct elements present in either of
# the arrays. If an element appears more than once in one or both arrays, it should be
# included only once in the result.
# Note: Elements of a[] and b[] are not necessarily distinct.
# Note that, You can return the Union in any order but the driver code will print the
# result in sorted order only.
# Examples:
# Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], b[] = [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2]
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
# Explanation: Union set of both the arrays will be 1, 2 and 3
